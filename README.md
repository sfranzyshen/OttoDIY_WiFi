## Motivation for the project

When developing with the OttoDIY Robot a few things can get in the way and sometimes make it difficult or even lead to failure. 


The first (and most obvious) is the need to install software and possibly hardware drivers onto a device before you can do anything. Downloading software from various sources and for a variety of platforms ... can be confusing. Also, not everyone has access to the needed files ... or sometime they are not for the available platform.


The second obstacle to OttoDIY development is the need to code, compile, and upload changes to the robot ... Yes, you could use mBlock to do "Live" coding ... but ultimately if you want your code to run stand alone ... You'll need to code, compile, and upload your changes to the OttoDIY Robot ...


Another inhibiting (and the most annoying) tether is the USB cable. What else can I say about it? Unless it's used to recharge the battery ... we going to ditch it and go fully wireless. (Not just a remote control like the Android App ...)
